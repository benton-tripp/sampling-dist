# Sampling Distribution Shiny App

This application enables the exploration of sampling distributions by generating 
multiple random samples from selected 'parent populations'â€”including Binomial, 
Beta, Cauchy, Chi-Square, Exponential, Gamma, Geometric, Normal, Poisson, and 
Uniform distributions. It calculates and visualizes statistics such as the sample 
mean, standardized sample mean, variance, standard deviation, median, maximum, and 
minimum. Through histograms, users can investigate how these statistics behave, 
depending on the population and sample size, facilitating a deeper understanding 
of sampling distributions and their significance in probability and statistics.

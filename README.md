# Sampling Distribution Shiny App

*[App Inspiration](https://shiny.stat.ncsu.edu/jbpost2/SamplingDistribution/)*

This application visualizes the sampling distribution of different statistics when sampling 
from different populations.

Statistics are random variables that have a distribution - called a sampling distribution. 
These distributions are of the utmost importance as they allow us to find probabilities about 
the statistic. The sampling distribution depends on the population from which it is sampled 
as well as the statistic you are investigating.

To understand the behavior of statistics, this application generates many random samples of a
chosen size, calculates the value of the statistic, and plots them on a histogram. These data 
sets can be stepped through and the histogram serves as an estimate of the sampling distribution.

This application allows the user to choose between many 'parent populations.' These are the
Binomial, Beta, Cauchy, Chi-Square, Exponential, Gamma, Geometric, Normal, Poisson, and Uniform
distributions.

The user can also choose from many different statistics. These are the sample mean, standardized
sample mean (subtracting the true mean and dividing by the true standard deviation), sample
variance, sample standard deviation, sample median, sample max, and sample min.
